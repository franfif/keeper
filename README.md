Keeper App

This project was a way to practice the React library, especially the React components and useState hooks with JavaScript.
It allows the user to create notes with a title and a content. The user can then delete the notes.
In this version of the app, the notes are not persistent and are deleted as soon as the user refresh the page, as the useState hook is reset.
